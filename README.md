# Zeebe Dapr Bridge

A bridge that allows to orchestrate [Dapr] microservices with the [Zeebe] workflow engine.

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed on the local developer machine. Please refer to the documentation of these tools to learn how to 
install them.
- [Helm]
- [Dapr]
- [kubectl]

To run [Zeebe] locally we need a local [Kubernetes] cluster installed. There are multiple possibilities to spin up a local cluster. 
This example will use [k3d] which is a lightweight wrapper to run [k3s] (Rancher Labâ€™s lightweight Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

**Note**: If you already have a local cluster or if you prefer to use another local Kubernetes distribution like [minikube], [microk8s], [kind] or
[Docker Desktop], please jump to [Install Zeebe into the cluster](#install-zeebe-into-the-cluster).

### Install k3d and spin up cluster

The installation process for various operating systems is described in the [k3d installation page]. After k3d was installed, we create 
a new cluster. The cluster needs at least three nodes because the [Operate] instance that we later install with [Zeebe], installs an 
[Elasticsearch] cluster which needs three nodes. We also disable the default ingress controller that comes with [k3d] because the [Zeebe]
cluster that we install, will deploy it's own ingress controller. The ports for the ingress controller will be mapped to localhost:8080 
for HTTP and localhost:8443 for HTTPS.

```bash
k3d cluster create zeebe \
    --servers 3 \
    --k3s-server-arg "--no-deploy=traefik" \
    -p 8080:80@loadbalancer \
    -p 8443:443@loadbalancer
```

### Install Zeebe into the cluster

Zeebe provides a [Helm] chart that deploys a complete [Zeebe] Cluster, the Operate UI and an ingress controller to [Kubernetes]. To use this 
helm chart we must add the official [Zeebe Helm] repo to [Helm]:

```bash
helm repo add zeebe https://helm.zeebe.io && helm repo update
```

Now we can install the helm chart into our cluster:
```bash
helm install zeebe-cluster zeebe/zeebe-full
```

The installation process takes some time. With the `kubeclt` command we can monitor the progress.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

If the cluster is ready it shows something similar to this:
```

```

Now we are able to access the [Operate] UI over `https://localhost:8443` and login with user `demo` and password `demo`.
